# üè¶ Bank Loan Report Dashboard using Power BI & Microsoft SQL Server

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** using **Power BI**, with data sourced directly from **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**. The dashboard provides an end-to-end analytical solution for monitoring loan performance, repayment trends, and borrower financial health through interactive visuals and KPIs.

The project includes **three key dashboards** ‚Äî **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details** ‚Äî each designed to give different levels of insights into the bank‚Äôs lending operations.

## üéØ Problem Statement

### **Dashboard 1: Summary**
The **Summary Dashboard** provides a holistic view of the bank‚Äôs key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor lending performance and financial health.

#### **KPI Requirements:**
1. **Total Loan Applications** ‚Äì Total applications received, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) tracking.  
2. **Total Funded Amount** ‚Äì Total amount disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM comparisons.  
3. **Total Amount Received** ‚Äì Amount received from borrowers to analyze repayment patterns (MTD & MoM).  
4. **Average Interest Rate** ‚Äì Average interest rate of all loans (MTD & MoM) to track changes in lending costs.  
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** ‚Äì Average borrower DTI, providing insights into financial stability (MTD & MoM).

#### **Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs**
**Good Loan Metrics:**
- Good Loan Application Percentage  
- Good Loan Applications  
- Good Loan Funded Amount  
- Good Loan Total Received Amount  

**Bad Loan Metrics:**
- Bad Loan Application Percentage  
- Bad Loan Applications  
- Bad Loan Funded Amount  
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount  

#### **Loan Status Grid View**
A grid report categorized by *Loan Status* showing:
- Total Loan Applications  
- Total Funded Amount  
- Total Amount Received  
- MTD Funded Amount  
- MTD Amount Received  
- Average Interest Rate  
- Average DTI  

This grid allows for better loan performance assessment and data-driven decision-making.

### **Dashboard 2: Overview**
The **Overview Dashboard** visualizes trends and distributions to understand lending behavior across time, geography, and borrower demographics.

#### **Charts Included:**
1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identify seasonality and trends in loan issuance.  
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Compare lending activities across regions.  
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Analyze loan distribution by term duration.  
4. **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Understand how borrower employment length impacts loan behavior.  
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Visualize loan distribution by purpose.  
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Show how home ownership status affects loan patterns.  

**Metrics Displayed:**  
- Total Loan Applications  
- Total Funded Amount  
- Total Amount Received

### **Dashboard 3: Details**
The **Details Dashboard** acts as a **comprehensive data view** for deeper exploration of loan-level information.

#### **Objective:**
To provide a one-stop, user-friendly interface for exploring:
- Borrower details  
- Loan applications  
- Repayment behavior  
- Performance metrics  

This dashboard enhances transparency and supports in-depth analysis of the loan portfolio.
